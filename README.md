# Route-optimisation

This repository contains the code for the IT365: Advanced Computer Networks Mini Project.  
We implement various route optimisation algorithms and evaluate the performance of these algorithms in different
scenarios such as node failures, traffic congestion etc.  

We compare the Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algo, Bellman Ford (RIP), Ant Colony optimisation and a backtracking algorithm.
The data folder has the graph data that we have used. Helper folder has helper functions and the visualisation file.  

To run the code:  
## cd implementation
## python3 main.py

To run the bfs module:  
## python3 bfs.py
